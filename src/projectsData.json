            "Description": "A procedurally generated underwater environment made for the course Procedural Methods for Images at Linköping University. The project let me improve my shader knowledge and learn how to create interesting shaders using Unity Shader Graph. It also let me understand how to work with procedurally generated meshes and procedurally placed game objects, both at start- and runtime.",

            "Description": "Simulation of a piece of cloth that was visualized in a 3D environment using OpenGL. The cloth uses interactive properties to change how the cloth behaves, and the simulation is based on the mass spring model. The project was developed in the course ''Modelling Project'' at Linköping University.",

            "Description": "This software is able to render images of 3D scenes in which light reflects between surfaces. It can handle spherical objects, as well as objects built out of triangular polygons. The software can also handle different surface materials that reflect the light differently. Monte Carlo ray tracing techniques are used to handle global illumination calculations.",

The game is a puzzle game where you race against the clock to disarm an explosive, gaining some more time for each stage solved. The game received very positive feedback and landed on overall 70th place, and with its highest rating in the ''Fun'' category, where it placed 59th.",
